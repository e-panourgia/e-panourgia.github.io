The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in cosmology – a broad discipline covering scientific, religious or philosophical aspects of the cosmos and its nature. Religious and philosophical approaches may include the cosmos among spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.</li>

<h3 id="origins-of-the-universe"><a name="origins_of_the_universe"></a><strong>Origins of the Universe</strong></h3>
<p>The most well-supported idea for the creation of our universe revolves around an event known as the big bang. This theory arose from the discovery that other galaxies are rapidly moving away from our own in all directions, as if driven by a powerful old explosive force.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, a Belgian priest called Georges Lemaître proposed the big bang theory, claiming that the cosmos began with a single primordial atom. The concept was bolstered by Edwin Hubble's discoveries that galaxies are rushing away from us in all directions, as well as Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson's discovery of cosmic microwave radiation in the 1960s, which they interpreted as echoes of the big bang.</p>
<p>The pace of the big bang has been clarified due to further research. Here's the theory: The cosmos was exceedingly compressed in the first 10^-43 seconds of its existence, less than a million billion billionth the size of a single atom. The four fundamental forces—gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces—are considered to have been forged into a single force in such an incomprehensibly dense, energetic state, but our present theories haven't yet figured out how such a single, unified force would work. We'd need to understand how gravity works on a subatomic scale to pull this off, something we currently can't do.</p>
<p>The extremely close quarters are also believed to have allowed the universe's earliest particles to mix, blend, and settle into approximately the same temperature. Then, in a fraction of a second, all that matter and energy spread outward more or less uniformly, with minor differences given by quantum-scale fluctuations. Inflation, a hypothesis of rapid expansion, could explain why the universe's temperature and matter distribution are so uniform.</p>
<p>The cosmos continued to grow after inflation, although at a considerably slower rate. It's still a mystery what fueled inflation.</p>

<h3 id="religious-cosmology"><a name="religious_cosmology"></a><strong>Religious Cosmology</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Religious Cosmology</strong> as a term is a way to explain the origin, the evolution and the fate of our universe from a religious viewpoint. It is claimed that there are multiple religious myths making hypothesis on how and why everything is the way we know it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Catholics believe God is an <strong>omnipotent</strong> creator of the universe due to the teachings of <strong>St Augustine (ex nihilo)</strong> and the book of Genesis. According to their beliefs, the creation story is not supposed to be taken literally. Catholic Christians understand these stories of creation in a symbolic way linked to the nature of the world and humanity. <strong>Pope John Paul II</strong>  insisted on the fact that Catholic belief and science are compatible. The theory of evolution is not rejected totally because it can be considered as part of God’s plan.</li>
<li>Some Christians support a more <strong>fundamentalist</strong> approach. According to their beliefs, the miracle of creation as it is described in the Bible is a logical explanation of what really happened – this thesis is widely known as <strong>creationism</strong>. Hence, the creation of the universe took place in <strong>six calendar days</strong>, based on the book of Genesis. This is linked with the opinion that the Bible is the voice of our flawless God.</li>
<li>In the Jewish religious theory, God is the <strong>creator and source</strong> of all elements of the universe. Jewish also follow the book of Genesis, the first book of the <strong>Torah (Jewish written law)</strong>. Most Orthodox Jews accept the Genesis like the ultimate written gift from God, as it was revealed to <strong>Moses</strong> on Mt Sinai. The creation of the universe is celebrated weekly by observing the <strong>Sabbath</strong> and through the festival of <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong>.</li>
<li>The Ancient Greeks believed that in the beginning, the only thing that existed was <strong>Chaos</strong>, or in other words, nothingness. Then all of a sudden, from light, came <strong>Gaia</strong> (Mother Earth). Then form Gaia came <strong>Uranus</strong> (the sky). <strong>Kronos</strong> the Titan, Gaia's son, married his sister Rhea and gave birth to 6 children,the gods. When Zeus grew up, he decided to fight the Titans. He won with the help of the hundred handed ones and the cyclops. After the war he cut his father Kronos into pieces and threw them into <strong>Tartarus</strong> (the underworld). Zeus was, from then on, the leader of the gods. Hades took over the Underworld. Poseidon took over the oceans. Zeus married his sister Hera and crowned her Queen of Olympus.</li>

<h3 id="flat-earth-theory"><a name="flat-earth_theory"></a><strong>Flat-Earth Theory</strong></h3>
<p>The flat Earth theory is an old and non-proven thesis according to which the Earth's shape is as a plane or disk. Many ancient civilizations, including Ancient Greece and China until 1600, believed in a flat Earth cosmography. These ideas nowadays are promoted by conspiracy clubs, despite scientific proof about Earth's sphericity. Flat-Earth stories are undoubtebly linked to elementary scientific errors that can be debunked.</p>

<h3 id="simulation-theory"><a name="simulation_theory"></a><strong>Simulation Theory</strong></h3>
<p>The simulation hypothesis implies that all of existence is an artificial simulation, such as a computer simulation, to explain the nature of existence. Some versions heavily depend on the creation of a simulated reality, a technology that would be able to persuade the simulation's residents that it really existed. The simulation hypothesis bears close resemblance to a number of other skeptical scenarios that have been proposed throughout philosophy's history. The hypothesis in its current form was popularized by Nick Bostrom. The idea that such a hypothesis is compatible with all perceived human experiences is linked with major epistemological implications, resulting in philosophical skepticism. The hypothesis is also very popular in science fiction, where it has been used as a central plot mechanism in many stories and films.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s at least a billion trillion!</li>
<li>A black hole is created when big stars explode. Its gravitational force is so strong that nothing can escape from it – luckily the closest black hole is about 10,000 light-years from Earth.</li>
<li>When venturing into space, astronauts wear spacesuits which have to be warmed, cooled, pressurised and supplied with fresh air. This takes six hours for them to put on!</li>
<li>The universe has no centre and is constantly expanding (getting bigger) every second – making it impossible to reach the edge.</li>
<li>The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old – but that’s only a third of the age of the universe – which is 13.5 billion years old!</li>
<li>The Earth is tiny in comparison with the rest of the universe – it could fit into the sun 1.3 million times.</li>
<li>The moon is the reason why we have tides and waves on Earth. Along with the sun, it moves billions of tonnes of water each day.</li>
<li>A day on Mercury lasts longer than its year! Mercury moves around the sun faster than any other planet – making its year the equivalent of 88 Earth days. While a day on Mercury – the interval between one sunrise and the next – lasts 176 Earth days!</li>
<li>In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a ‘dwarf planet’ after 76 years classified as the outermost planet in our solar system since its discovery in 1930.</li>
<li>Only about 4.9% of the mass-energy of the universe is atoms: the stuff of which you, I, the stars and galaxies are made, and only half of that has been discovered with telescopes. Thus, 95% of the universe is invisible.</li>
<li>In space there is no atmosphere, which means that sound has no medium to travel in order to be heard. Astronauts use radios to stay in touch while in space because radio waves can still be sent and received.</li>
<li>Despite the search for intelligent signals, no evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life has yet been found. In fact, there is a good argument that if such life forms exist out there, we should not only see signs of them, but that they should have already come here.</li>

<h3 id="end-of-the-universe"><a name="end_of_the_universe"></a><strong>End of the Universe</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, billions of years from now, the universe will be destroyed completely. Scientists cannot estimate or described this natural phenomenon of vital importance, but they can assume the following.</p>
<h4 id="the-big-rip">The big rip</h4>
<p>Not only is our universe expanding, but it's expanding equally in all directions. As a result, galaxies are getting farther apart. The space within each galaxy is also expanding, but at the moment, the galaxy's own gravity is strong enough to hold it together.</p>
<p>The big rip would be initiated once the pull of the universe's expansion gets stronger than the gravity holding galaxies together. Galaxies would tear apart first, followed by smaller black holes, planets and stars.</p>
<p>Eventually space would start expanding faster than the speed of light, and become stronger than the forces holding atoms together. Therefore, they'd break down into individual particles. The whole universe would become a void of single particles unconnected to anything around them, drifting aimlessly in a timeless universe.</p>
<h4 id="the-big-crunch">The big crunch</h4>
<p>This is the most optimistic scenario. If scientists are wrong about dark energy and there's actually less of it than we assume, or its grasp on matter decreases over time, gravity would one day become the most significant force in the universe.</p>
<p>If that occurs, then after trillions of years, the rate that the universe expands would decrease and the universe would start to shrink. Galaxies would crash into each other and merge as the universe starts collapsing on itself.</p>
<p>A shrinking universe would drive temperatures higher. The cosmic background radiation would be so hot that it would cook stars from the outside in. The intense heat would rip atoms apart in the final minutes before the Big Crunch. Black holes would then swallow up everything since objects are packed so tightly into dense clumps.</p>
<p>The black holes would then converge into one mega black hole that contains the entirety of the universe. The Big Crunch moment would happen instantly as the black hole swallows itself.</p>
<p>Some astrophysicists believe that the universe has bounced back and forth between expansion and contraction, so there's definite hope for a universe rebirth in this scenario, although we will not be able to witness it.</p>
<h4 id="the-big-freeze-or-heat-death">The big freeze or heat death</h4>
<p>In this last end-of-the-universe scenario, matter would stay intact rather than getting torn apart, but would slowly decay into radiation as the universe expands.</p>
<p>Right now the universe is not uniform — it's speckled with clumps of matter and energy in the form of things like galaxies, stars, and black holes. But the expansion would stretch everything out until everything is evenly spread through the universe. When that occurs, objects can gain or lose energy. The gas clouds that form stars would dissipate, black holes would evaporate and eventually even light particles would fizzle out. The universe would be completely snuffed out forever.</p>

<p>At first, there was only chaos. Then out of the void appeared Night and Erebus, the place where death dwells. Everything else was empty, silent and dark. Then Love (Eros) was born, bringing a start to order. From Love came Light and Day. Once there was Light and Day, Gaea the earth appeared.</p>
<p>Then Erebus slept with Night, who gave birth to Aether the heavenly light, and then to Day the earthly light. Then Night alone produced Doom, Fate, Death, Sleep, Dreams, Nemesis, and others that come to man out of darkness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gaea alone gave birth to Ouranos the heavens. Ouranos became Gaea's mate, covering her on all sides. Together they produced the three Cyclops, the three Hecatoncheires, and twelve Titans.</p>

</br></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Antarctica is the southernmost continent on Earth, where the geographic South Pole is located. It is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. With an area of 14.0 million square kilometres, it is the fifth largest continent on the planet after Asia, Africa, North America and South America. For comparison, Antarctica is twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica's surface is covered by ice with an average thickness of at least 1.9 km.</p>
<p>Antarctica is on average the driest, coldest and windiest continent with  the highest average elevation. Since it has an  annual precipitation of 200 mm  along the coast and much less inland, it is considered  a polar desert. It holds frozen about the 70% of fresh water, which if melted would make the global sea levels to raise by over 60 metres (200 ft). Antarctica's lowest measured temperature,and also Earth's, is  −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F). Only cold-adapted organisms can live in Antarctica, including many species of algae, animals (for example mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and sloths), bacteria, fungi, plants and protists. The vegetation, where it occurs, is of tundra type.</p>

</br></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Asia is the largest and most populous of all the planet's continents, with its bigger part being located in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. With the continent of Europe it makes the continental landmass of Eurasia , and with both Africa and Europe the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia. Asia occupies an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), which accounts for about 8.7% of the total surface area  and 30% of the land area of the planet. Asia, which has been hosting the biggest part of the human population, was the birthplace of many of the earliest civilizations. Its 4.7 billion inhabitants make up about 60% of the world's population.</p>
<p>Regarding its surroundings, the continent is bordered by the Pacific Ocean  on the east,  by the Indian Ocean on the south, and  by the Arctic Ocean on the north. Asia's border with Europe is a human construct, as there is not any  physical and natural separation between them. The division of Eurasia into two continents is a result of the several East–West differences regarding their cultures, languages and ethnicities. A commonly accepted division places Asia east of the Suez Canal, which separates it from Africa; and east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and the Ural River, and south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas, which separate it from Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Europe is  located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and  in the Eastern Hemisphere. It encompasses the westernmost peninsulas of the continental mass of Eurasia and shares the continental mass of Afro-Eurasia with Asia and Africa. It is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean to the north,  the Mediterranean Sea to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and Asia to the east. Europe's commonly accepted borders with  Asia are  the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Despite most of its borders are land borders, Europe's great physical size and important history are enough for it to be considered its own continent.</p>
<p>By covering about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi) and  2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), Europe is considered the second-smallest continent.  Europe is organized into about fifty different sovereign states, out of which Russia is the largest one, since it spans 39% of the continent, and the most populous one, since it comprises about 15% of the continent's population. In 2018, Europe's total population was about 746 million, which translates to 10% of the Earth's population. The continent's climate is heavily influenced by  warm Atlantic currents that moderate summers and winters across most of its land. In places  away from the sea, seasonal differences are a lot more intense than in those near the coast.</p>

<p>North America is located in the Nothern Hemisphere and for its main part in th Western Hemisphere. Accordingly to the 6 continents theory, it can be considered as a subcontinent of America. It is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean to the north,  by South America and the Caribbean Sea  to the southeast,  by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and by the Pacific Ocean to the west and south. Greenland is considered as part of North America geographically due to the fact that it's located on the North American Tectonic Plate.</p>
<p>North America occupies  an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), which translates to  about 16.5% of the planet's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. It is considered the third largest continent concerning its area, after Asia and Africa and the fourth concerning its population, following Asia, Africa and Europe. According to the United Nations average population estimation for 2021, its population is estimated at 596,592,000 inhabitants, about 7.6% of the world's population.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>"A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and starts to release gases, a process that is called outgassing." This produces a visible atmosphere and a tail. These phenomena happens due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma can be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. An astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to Sun or aprox. 150 million kilometeres. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. From the ancient times people have been observing and recording comets.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>
<br>
The first known interstellar object to visit our solar system, was discovered Oct. 19, 2017 by the University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope. While originally classified as a comet, observations revealed no signs of cometary activity after it slingshotted past the Sun on Sept. 9, 2017 at a blistering speed of 196,000 miles per hour (87.3 kilometers per second). It was briefly classified as an asteroid until new measurements found it was accelerating slightly, a sign it behaves more like a comet.</p>
<p>“For decades we’ve theorized that such interstellar objects are out there, and now―for the first time―we have direct evidence they exist,” said Thomas Zurbuchen.

Comet Hale-Bopp (formally known as "C/1995 O1") is regarded as one of the most widely viewed comets in history. The comet that reached close to Earth in 1997 is also known for being unusually bright. It was visible to the naked eye for 18 months, thus the  comet became a spectacular sight in early 1997 especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp discovered the comet independently on July 23, 1995.

<br>
81P/Wild (Wild 2) (Wild is pronounced vilt) is a small comet with the shape of a flattened sphere and measures about 1.03 x 1.24 x 1.71 miles (1.65 x 2 x 2.75 kilometers). It takes Wild 2 nearly six and a half years (6.41) to orbit the Sun once. Wild 2 last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2016.Comet Wild 2 is known as a fresh periodic comet. Wild 2 orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but it did not always travel the course of its orbit here. Originally, this comet's orbit lay between that of Uranus and Jupiter. On 10 Sept. 10, 1974, gravitational interactions between this comet and the planet Jupiter pulled the comet's orbit into a new shape. Paul Wild discovered this comet during its first revolution of the Sun on the new orbit

<p><strong>Description</strong>
<br>
55P/Tempel-Tuttle (commonly known as Comet Tempel-Tuttle) is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 33 years. It fits the classic definition of a Halley-type comet, with a period between 20 and 200 years. Discovered by Wilhelm Tempel on 19 December 1865 and by Horace Parnell Tuttle on 6 January 1866. It is the parent body of the Leonids. It was observed by Gottfried Kirch in 1699, but not confirmed as a periodic comet until the discovery of Temple and Tuttle during perihelion in 1866. In 1933, S. Kanda certified that the comet of 1366 was Tempel-Tuttle, which was confirmed by Joachim Schubart in 1965. On October 26, 1366, the comet passed 0.0229 AU (3,430,000 km; 2,130,000 mi) from Earth.</p>
<p>55P/Tempel-Tuttle's orbit intersects Earth's orbit almost exactly, so the stream of material ejected from the comet during its perihelion pass doesn't need to spread out over time to hit Earth. The comet's current Earth MOID is 0.008 AU (1,200,000 km; 740,000 mi). This coincidence means the comet's stream is still impenetrable when it hits Earth at perihelion, leading to the Leonid meteor shower's 33-year cycle. For example, in November 2009, Earth passed a meteor left largely by orbits 1466 and 1533. In February 2016, two bolides discovered by NASA's All-Sky Fireball Network were calculated to have orbits consistent with 55P, although their 100-degree nodes were less than 55P. The reason for this has not been clarified. The core mass of 55P/Tempel-Tuttle is estimated to be 1.2 × 1013 kg, with a radius of 1.8 km, and a mass flux of 5 × 1012 kg.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to have life on it. Although there is plenty of water across the Solar System, only Earth has liquid surface water. The oceans, lakes, rivers and dwarfing Earth's polar ice, cover over 71% of the Earth's surface. Mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are generated by the interaction of several slowly moving tectonic plates that make up the Earth's surface layer. The magnetic field that forms Earth's magnetosphere and deflects destructive solar winds is generated by the liquid outer core of the planet.</p>
<p>Nitrogen and oxygen make up the majority of the Earth's atmosphere. Tropical regions receive more solar energy than polar regions, which is then redistributed by air and ocean circulation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap a portion of the Sun's energy near the surface. The climate of a region is influenced by latitude, elevation, and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heat waves, may occur in almost any location and significantly impact life.</p>
<p>The Earth is an ellipse with a circumference of approximately 40,000 kilometers. It is the Solar System's densest planet. It is the biggest and most massive of the four rocky planets. The earth orbits the Sun, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution and is about eight light minutes away from it. Seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation in relation to its orbital plane with the Sun. The Moon, Earth's only permanent natural satellite, revolves at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is about a fourth the size of Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon constantly faces the Earth on the same side, causing tides, stabilizing the Earth's axis, and progressively slowing its rotation.</p>
<p>Over 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth was formed. The ocean created throughout the first billion years of Earth's existence, and life developed inside it. Life expanded over the world, affecting the atmosphere and surface of the Earth, resulting in the Earth's Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans first appeared 300,000 years ago and have now reached a population of almost 8 billion. Humans rely on the biosphere and natural resources of the Earth to survive, yet they are having an increasingly negative influence on the ecosystem. Humanity's current influence on the Earth's climate, soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, endangering people's lives and triggering widespread extinction of other species.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Jupiter is the Solar System's biggest planet and the fifth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant with a mass slightly less than one-thousandth that of the Sun, but more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. After the Moon and Venus, Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky. It was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, and has been seen since prehistoric times.</p>
<p>Although Jupiter is mostly made up of hydrogen, helium accounts for one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. Jupiter, like the other giant planets, is thought to have a rocky core with heavy components, although it lacks a well-defined solid surface. The heat generated by its interior contraction is larger than the heat absorbed from the Sun. The planet's shape is an oblate spheroid, with a minor but perceptible bulge near the equator due to its fast spin. At different latitudes, the outer atmosphere is visually divided into many bands, with turbulence and storms at their interacting boundaries. The Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been seen by telescopes since at least the 17th century, is one of the prominent results of this.</p>
<p>Jupiter is surrounded by a robust magnetosphere and a faint planetary ring system. Jupiter's magnetic tail is over 800 million kilometers long (5.3 AU; 500 million miles) and spans nearly the entire distance between Jupiter and Saturn's orbit. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are the four massive Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more. Io and Europa are almost the same size as Earth's Moon; Callisto is about as big as Mercury, and Ganymede is considerably bigger.</p>
<p>Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, arriving in December 1973 at its closest approach. Since then, robotic spacecraft have visited Jupiter on multiple times, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions in 1973 and 1979, and subsequently with the Galileo orbiter, which arrived in 1995. The New Horizons spacecraft visited Jupiter in 2007, utilizing its gravity to accelerate and bend its trajectory on its way to Pluto. Juno, the most recent spacecraft to visit Jupiter, entered orbit around the planet in July 2016. The likely ice-covered liquid ocean of Europa is a future target for investigation in Jupiter's system.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the Solar System's second-smallest planet, only Mercury being smaller. Mars is known as the "Red Planet" in English because it carries the name of the Roman god of war. The latter refers to the reddish appearance of Mars in the sky as a result of the iron oxide present on its surface. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, impact craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps on its surface.</p>
<p>Because their rotation period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar, the days and seasons are analogous to those of Earth. Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the Solar System's tallest volcano and highest known mountain, as well as Valles Marineris, one of the Solar System's greatest canyons. The smooth Borealis basin, which encompasses 40% of the earth in the Northern Hemisphere, might represent a massive impact structure. Phobos and Deimos, Mars' two moons, are tiny and oddly shaped.</p>
<p>Several uncrewed spacecrafts have visited Mars. Mariner 4 was the first spacecraft to visit Mars, arriving on the planet on July 15, 1965, after being launched by NASA on November 28, 1964. Mariner 4 discovered the weak Martian radiation belt, which is only 0.1 percent that of Earth, and took the first deep-space photos of another planet. CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and Zhurong rover were the most recent spacecraft to safely land on Mars, on May 14, 2021. The Zhurong rover was successfully deployed on May 22, 2021, making China the second country after the United States to successfully deploy a rover on Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Mercury is the smallest and nearest planet to the Sun in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun is the shortest of all the Sun's planets, taking 87.97 Earth days. It is named after Mercurius (Mercury), the Roman god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, who corresponds to the Greek god Hermes. Mercury, like Venus, orbits the Sun as an inferior planet inside Earth's orbit, and its apparent distance from the Sun as seen from Earth never surpasses 28°. Due to its close closeness to the Sun, the planet may only be seen in twilight near the western horizon after sunset or near the eastern horizon before sunrise. It appears to be a bright star-like object at this time, but it is more difficult to see than Venus. From Earth, the planet, like Venus and the Moon, telescopically displays the full spectrum of phases, which recur about every 116 days.</p>
<p>Mercury rotates in a way that no other planet in the Solar System does. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, which means that it rotates on its axis three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun, relative to the fixed stars. It appears to rotate just once every two Mercurian years as seen from the Sun in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion. As a result, an observer on Mercury would only witness one day every two Mercurian years.</p>
<p>Mercury has the shortest tilt of any planet in the Solar System (about 1⁄30 degree). Mercury's orbital eccentricity is the highest of any known planets in the Solar System; its distance from the Sun during perihelion is only around two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface is extensively cratered and resembles the Moon's in appearance, indicating that it has been geologically dormant for billions of years. Its surface temperatures change more diurnally than any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (173 °C; 280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day throughout the equatorial regions, owing to the lack of an atmosphere to retain heat. The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Neptune is the eighth and most distant of the Solar System's planets from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Its mass is 17 times that of Earth, and it is somewhat more massive than Uranus, its near-twin. Because its greater mass provokes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere, Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus. It is one of the two ice giant planets in the solar system (the other one being its near-twin Uranus).</p>
<p>It has no well-defined "solid surface" because it is mostly made up of gases and liquids. At an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi), the planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years. It has the astronomical symbol ♆, which represents Neptune's trident, and is named after the Roman god of the sea.</p>
<p>Neptune is the only planet in the Solar System that was discovered by mathematical prediction rather than direct observation. Alexis Bouvard deduced that Uranus' orbit was vulnerable to gravitational disturbance by an undiscovered planet because of unexpected variations in its orbit. Following Bouvard's death, John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier separately projected Neptune's position based on his observations. Johann Galle sighted Neptune using a telescope on September 23, 1846, within a degree of the location predicted by Le Verrier. Triton, the planet's biggest moon, was discovered soon after, but none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were detected telescopically until the 20th century. Because of its great distance from Earth, the planet appears to be incredibly small, making it difficult to investigate with Earth-based telescopes. When Voyager 2 flew by Neptune on August 25, 1989, it was the sole spacecraft to have visited the planet; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. The Hubble Space Telescope, as well as big ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics, have lately made it possible to make more precise views from afar.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and, after Jupiter, the second-largest planet in the Solar System. It's a gas giant with a radius around nine and a half times that of the Earth. Saturn has an average density of one-eighth that of Earth, yet it is 95 times more massive due to its bigger volume.</p>
<p>The interior of Saturn is most likely made up of an iron–nickel and rock core (silicon and oxygen compounds). A deep layer of metallic hydrogen surrounds the core, followed by an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and lastly a gaseous outer layer. Ammonia crystals in Saturn's upper atmosphere give it a light yellow hue. Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's bigger size and is assumed to be caused by an electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer. The magnetic field strength of Saturn is about one-twentieth that of Jupiter. Although long-lived characteristics can appear, the outer atmosphere is mainly flat and lacking of contrast. Saturn has wind speeds of 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), which are higher than Jupiter but not as high as Neptune.</p>
<p>The planet's most noticeable characteristic is its large ring system, which is primarily composed of ice particles with a tiny amount of rocky debris and dust. Saturn has at least 83 moons, 53 of which are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's biggest moon and the Solar System's second largest, is bigger than Mercury, although being less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Uranus is the planet closest to the Sun. Its name is a reference to Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, who was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter), and father of Cronus (Saturn), according to Greek mythology. It possesses the Solar System's third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass. Uranus and Neptune are chemically similar, although their bulk chemical compositions differ from those of Jupiter and Saturn the larger gas giants. As a result, Uranus and Neptune are frequently referred to as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets.</p>
<p>Ice giants, like gas giants, lack a precisely articulated "solid surface." Uranus' atmosphere has a basic composition of hydrogen and helium comparable to Jupiter's and Saturn's, but it also includes additional "ices" such water, ammonia, and methane, as well as traces of other hydrocarbons. It possesses the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (224 °C; 371 °F) and a complex, layered cloud structure, with water assumed to make up the lowest clouds and methane the highest. Uranus' interior is mostly made up of ice and rock.</p>
<p>Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and multiple moons, just like the other major planets. Because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit, the Uranian system has a distinct configuration. As a result, its north and south poles are located where the equators of most other planets are located. In 1986, images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft revealed Uranus to be a nearly featureless planet in visible light, lacking the cloud bands and storms seen on other big planets. The only spacecraft to visit the planet is Voyager 2. As Uranus reached its equinox in 2007, observations from Earth revealed seasonal changes and increasing weather activity. Wind speeds of up to 250 meters per second (900 km/h; 560 mph) have been recorded.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Venus is the planet closest to the Sun. It is called after Venus, the Roman goddess of beauty and love. After the Moon, Venus is the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky, and it may cast shadows and be seen by the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus' orbit is smaller than Earth's, but it has a maximum elongation of 47°, thus it may be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a few hours before or after dawn or sunset, depending on the observer's latitude and Venus' and Sun's locations. It may be viewed most of the time, either in the morning or in the evening. It may even be seen for a short period in a completely black sky. Every 224.7 Earth days, Venus orbits the Sun. It has a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days and a synodic day length of 117 Earth days. As a result, it takes longer than any other planet in the Solar System to circle around its axis, and it rotates in the opposite direction of all except Uranus. This indicates that the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Venus is the only planet in the Solar System without any moons, a characteristic it shares solely with Mercury.</p>
<p>Because of their comparable size, mass, closeness to the Sun, and bulk composition, Venus is frequently referred to as Earth's "sister planet." In other aspects, it is vastly different from Earth. It possesses the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, with a carbon dioxide content of almost 96%. The air pressure at the planet's surface is around 92 times that of Earth's sea level pressure, or nearly that of 900 meters (3,000 ft) underwater. Venus has the warmest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), despite Mercury's proximity to the Sun. Venus is covered in an opaque layer of highly reflecting sulfuric acid clouds, preventing light from reaching its surface. It may have formerly had water oceans, but these would have evaporated when the temperature rose due to the greenhouse effect. Because there is no planetary magnetic field, the water has presumably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been carried into interplanetary space by the solar wind.</p>
<p>For as long as records have existed, Venus has been a significant fixture in human culture as one of the brightest things in the sky. Many cultures have declared it special to their gods, and it has served as a source of inspiration for artists and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star." As early as the second millennium BC, Venus was the first planet to have its movements traced across the sky.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Ceres (/ˈsɪəriːz/;[17] minor-planet designation: 1 Ceres) is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Ceres was the first asteroid discovered, on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily. Originally considered a planet, it was reclassified as an asteroid in the 1850s after the discovery of dozens of other objects in similar orbits. In 2006, it was reclassified again as a dwarf planet – the only one always inside Neptune's orbit – because, at 940 km (580 mi) in diameter, it is the only asteroid large enough for its gravity to make it plastic and to maintain it as a spheroid.</p>
<p>Ceres's small size means that even at its brightest it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies. Its apparent magnitude ranges from 6.7 to 9.3, peaking at opposition (when it is closest to Earth) once every 15- to 16-month synodic period. Its surface features are barely visible even with the most powerful telescopes, and little was known of them until the robotic NASA spacecraft Dawn approached Ceres for its orbital mission in 2015.</p>
<p>Dawn found Ceres's surface to be a mixture of water ice and hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. Gravity data suggest Ceres to be partially differentiated into a muddy (ice-rock) mantle/core and a less-dense but stronger crust that is at most 30% ice by volume. Ceres's small size means that any internal ocean of liquid water it may once have possessed has likely frozen by now. It is not completely frozen, however: brines still flow through the outer mantle and reach the surface, allowing cryovolcanoes such as Ahuna Mons to form at the rate of about one every 50 million years. This makes Ceres the closest known cryovolcanic body to the Sun, and the brines provide a potential habitat for microbial life.</p>
<p>In January 2014, emissions of water vapor were detected around Ceres, creating a tenuous, transient atmosphere known as an exosphere. This was unexpected because asteroids typically do not emit vapor, a hallmark of comets.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. It was the first object identified in the Kuiper belt, and it is still the biggest known object in the region. Pluto was proclaimed the ninth planet from the Sun after its discovery in 1930. Following the discovery of other objects of comparable size in the Kuiper belt and dispersed disc, including the dwarf planet Eris, its existence as a planet was questioned beginning in the 1990s. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006, which formally defined the word planet.</p>
<p>Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-massive object known to orbit the Sun directly. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object in terms of volume, yet it is smaller than Eris in terms of mass. Pluto, like other Kuiper belt objects, is mostly formed of ice and rock and is relatively small—one-sixth the mass and one-third the volume of the Moon. It orbits the Sun at a fairly eccentric and inclined angle, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (AU) (4.4–7.4 billion miles). This means Pluto gets closer to the Sun than Neptune on a regular basis, yet a stable orbital resonance with Neptune keeps them from colliding. At Pluto's typical distance, light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach it (39.5 AU).</p>
<p>Pluto has five known moons: Charon (the biggest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra (the smallest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto). Because the barycenter of their orbits does not fall within either body, Pluto and Charon are sometimes called a binary system.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Eris is the Solar System's most massive and second-largest dwarf planet. It has a high-eccentricity orbit and is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the scattered disk. A Palomar Observatory-based team lead by Mike Brown found Eris in January 2005, and it was confirmed later that year. It was named after the Greco-Roman goddess of strife and discord in September 2006. Eris is the Solar System's ninth-most massive object orbiting the Sun, and the Solar System's sixteenth-most massive object overall (counting moons). It is also the world's biggest object that has yet to be visited by a spacecraft. Eris has a diameter of 2,326 12 kilometers (1,445 7 miles), and its mass is 0.28% that of the Earth and 27% that of Pluto, despite Pluto being somewhat bigger by volume. Eris may complete one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day similar to ours in length. Sources, however, differ on the rotation period.</p>
<p>Dysnomia is Eris' only big known moon. Eris orbited the Sun at a distance of 96.3 astronomical units (1.4411010 km; 8.95109 mi) in February 2016, more than three times that of Neptune or Pluto. Until the discovery of 2018 VG18 in 2018, Eris and Dysnomia were the most distant known natural objects in the Solar System, with the exception of long-period comets.</p>
<p>Eris was initially classified as the Solar System's tenth planet by NASA, because it seemed to be bigger than Pluto. This, together with the possibility of future discoveries of objects of similar size, prompted the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term planet for the first time. Eris, along with Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, and Makemake, is classified as a "dwarf planet" by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), bringing the total number of known planets in the Solar System to eight, the same as before Pluto's discovery in 1930. Eris was very slightly smaller than Pluto, which was assessed by New Horizons as 2,377 4 kilometers (1,477 ± 2 mi) in July 2015, based on observations of a stellar occultation by it in 2010.</p>

<p>Haumea is a dwarf planet that it is located in the Kuiper Belt beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and it is approximately the same size as Pluto. The temperature in Haumea seems to be very low, so it doesn't has conditions suitable for life. The radius of Haumea is about 620 kilometers which means that is about 1/14 the radius of Earth. Haumea in order to make one trip around the Sun, it needs 285 Earth years.</p>
<p>Haumea also has two known moons. The first one is Namaka (the inner moon) and the second one is Hi'iaka (the outter moon). They took their names from the mythological daughters of Haumea.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Makemake is a dwarf planet and perhaps the second-largest Kuiper belt object in the classical population, with a diameter approximately two-thirds that of Pluto.It has one known satellite. Its extremely low average temperature, about 40 K (−230 °C), means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices.</p>
<p>Makemake was discovered on March 31, 2005 by a team led by Michael E. Brown, and announced on July 29, 2005. It was initially known as 2005 FY9 and later given the minor-planet number 136472. </p>
<p>Makemake is currently visually the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 it will pass from its present constellation Coma Berenices to Boötes in December 2027. It is bright enough to be visible using a high-end amateur telescope.</p>
<p>Combining the detection in infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Telescope with the similarities of spectrum with Pluto yielded an estimated diameter from 1,360 to 1,480 km.</p>
<p>Like Pluto, Makemake appears red in the visible spectrum, and significantly redder than the surface of Eris (see colour comparison of TNOs). The near-infrared spectrum is marked by the presence of the broad methane (CH4) absorption bands. Methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker.</p>

<h2 id="earth-like-planets_1"><a name="earthlikeplanets"></a> <strong><em>Earth-like Planets</em></strong></h2>
<p>A planet must be small (and thus rocky) and orbit in the "habitable zone" of its star to qualify as possibly life-friendly. The "habitable zone" is informally defined as a position where water can exist in liquid form on a world's surface. The size difference between a dwarf planet and a planet is the most important distinction. Dwarf planets lack the gravitational forces required to pull in and gather all of the material in their orbits due to their relatively small size.</p>

Furthermore, Gliese is far closer to its star than the earth is to the sun, as it completes an orbit around its star in less than 30 days.
Despite the great distance, Gliese 667 Cc's environment is nevertheless considered Earth-like, thanks to the fact that its star is a Red Dwarf with temperatures that are significantly lower than our Sun's.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula, is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs) from Earth and the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1 trillion solar masses (2.0×1042 kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. This has been called into question by a 2018 study that cited a lower estimate on the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy, combined with preliminary reports on a 2019 study estimating a higher mass of the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 220,000 ly (67 kpc), making it the largest member of the Local Group in terms of extension.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Cosmos Redshift 7 (also known as COSMOS Redshift 7, Galaxy Cosmos Redshift 7, Galaxy CR7 or CR7) is a high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitter galaxy. At a redshift z = 6.6, the galaxy is observed as it was about 800 million years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of reionisation. With a light travel time of 12.9 billion years, it is one of the oldest, most distant galaxies known.</p>
<p>CR7 shows some of the expected signatures of Population III stars i.e. the first generation of stars produced during early galaxy formation. These signatures were detected in a bright pocket of blue stars; the rest of the galaxy contains redder Population II stars.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Hoag's Object is a non-typical galaxy of the type known as a ring galaxy. It is named after Arthur Hoag, who discovered it in 1950 and identified it as either a planetary nebula or a peculiar galaxy. The galaxy has approximately eight billion stars, and is roughly 100,000 light years across.</p>
<p>A nearly perfect ring of young hot blue stars circles the older yellow nucleus of this ring galaxy c. 600 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens. The diameter of the 6 arcsecond inner core of the galaxy is about 17±0.7 kly (5.3±0.2 kpc) while the surrounding ring has an inner 28″ diameter of 75±3 kly (24.8±1.1 kpc) and an outer 45″ diameter of 121±4 kly (39.9±1.7 kpc). The galaxy is estimated to have a mass of 700 billion suns. By comparison, the Milky Way galaxy has an estimated diameter of 150-200 kly and consists of between 100 and 500 billion stars and a mass of around 1.54 trillion suns.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Mayall's Object (also classified under the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 148) is the result of two colliding galaxies located 500 million light years away within the constellation of Ursa Major. It was discovered by American astronomer Nicholas U. Mayall of the Lick Observatory on 13 March 1940, using the Crossley reflector. When first discovered, Mayall's Object was described as a peculiar nebula, shaped like a question mark. Originally theorized to represent a galaxy reacting with the intergalactic medium, it is now thought to represent the collision of two galaxies, resulting in a new object consisting of a ring-shaped galaxy with a tail emerging from it. It is thought that the collision between the two galaxies created a shockwave that initially drew matter into the center which then formed the ring.</p>
<p>Arp 148 was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope as part of a survey of what are thought to be colliding galaxies. The image was taken with Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 instrument. It was released along with 59 other images of this type in 2008 for that space telescopes' 18th anniversary.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle." From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Triangulum that is 2.73 million light-years (ly) from Earth. Messier 33 or NGC 598 is the name of the galaxy. The Triangulum Galaxy, after the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way, is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies. It's one of the furthest permanent objects visible from Earth with the naked eye.</p>
<p>The galaxy is the smallest spiral galaxy in the Local Group (although the smaller Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may have been spirals before their encounters with the Milky Way), and it is thought to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy or on its way to collide with it in the night sky due to their interactions, velocities, and proximity.. It also has an H II nucleus.</p>
<p>The Triangulum Galaxy can be viewed with the naked eye in extraordinary viewing conditions with no light pollution; for those observers, it will occasionally be the farthest permanent thing visible without magnification. Its light diffuses (spreads) across a bit more than a pinprick of the unmagnified sky due to its broadness — astronomers refer to this as a diffuse, rather than compact, object.</p>

<p><img width="500" height="350" src="media\photos\natural_satellites\Moons_of_solar_system_v7.jpg"></p>
<p>In the most common sense, a natural satellite is an astronomical body that circles a planet, dwarf planet, or minor Solar System entity (or sometimes another natural satellite). Natural satellites are commonly referred to as moons, a term derived from Earth's Moon.</p>
<p>There are 171 moons around the planets in our solar system, with 1, 2, 66, 62, 27, and 13 moons orbiting Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, respectively.</p>
<p>What are natural satellites used for?</p>
<p>A natural satellite in astronomy is a smaller body which moves around a larger body. The smaller body is held in orbit by gravitation. The above term is used for moons which go around planets, but also for small galaxies which orbit larger galaxies.</p>

<h3 id="moon"><a name="moon"></a><strong>Moon</strong></h3>
<p>The Moon is the sole natural satellite of the Earth. It is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System proportional to the size of a giant planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and larger than any known dwarf planet, with a diameter of nearly one-quarter the diameter of Earth (equivalent to the width of Australia). Under geophysical criteria, the Moon is a satellite planet since it is a planetary-mass object that became a differentiated rocky body. It doesn't have an atmosphere, a hydrosphere, or a magnetic field. It has a surface gravity of about one-sixth that of Earth (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite known to have a higher surface gravity and density in the Solar System. </p>
<p>Its gravitational impact slowly lengthens Earth's day and is the principal driver of Earth's tides, orbiting at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or nearly 30 times Earth's diameter. The sidereal duration of the Moon's orbit around Earth is 27.3 days. The amount of visible surface lighted by the Sun fluctuates from none to 100% during each synodic period of 29.5 days, resulting in lunar phases that serve as the foundation for lunar calendar months. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its axis causes the same side (the near side) to constantly face Earth, and the synodic period is the same as the lunar day. However, because to perspective distortions caused by libration, Earth can see 59 percent of the complete lunar surface. </p>

<p>Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter (Jupiter III), is the largest and most massive of the Solar System's moons. The ninth-largest object (including the Sun) of the Solar System, it is the largest without a substantial atmosphere. It has a diameter of 5,268 km (3,273 mi), making it 26 percent larger than the planet Mercury by volume, although it is only 45 percent as massive. Possessing a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System and is the only moon known to have a magnetic field. Outward from Jupiter, it is the seventh satellite and the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet. Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.</p>
<p>Ganymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of it. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating </p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>"Spaceflight (or space flight) is an application of astronautics to fly spacecraft into or through outer space, either with or without humans on board". Another definion for space exploration (Britannica, 2018), is that it is considered an investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity.  The first theoritical proposal of space travel using rockets was published by Scottish in an 1861 essay. Fifty (50) years later Spaceflight became an possibility with the work of Robert H. Goddard's publication. His application of the de Laval nozzle to liquid fuel rockets improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible.</p>
<p>Humans have always looked at the heavens and wondered about the nature of the objects seen in the night sky. With the development of rockets and the advances in electronics and other technologies in the 20th century, it became possible to send machines and animals and then people above Earth’s atmosphere into outer space. Well before technology made these achievements possible, however, space exploration had already captured the minds of many people, not only aircraft pilots and scientists but also writers and artists. The strong hold that space travel has always had on the imagination may well explain why professional astronauts and laypeople alike consent at their great peril, in the words of Tom Wolfe in The Right Stuff (1979), to sit “on top of an enormous Roman candle, such as a Redstone, Atlas, Titan or Saturn rocket, and wait for someone to light the fuse.” It perhaps also explains why space exploration has been a common and enduring theme in literature and art. As centuries of speculative fiction in books and more recently in films make clear, “one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind” was taken by the human spirit many times and in many ways before Neil Armstrong stamped humankind’s first footprint on the Moon.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. The first human to go into space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched, again by the Soviet Union, for a one-orbit journey around Earth on April 12, 1961. Within 10 years of that first human flight, American astronauts walked on the surface of the Moon. Apollo 11 crew members Neil Armstrong and Edwin (“Buzz”) Aldrin made the first lunar landing on July 20, 1969. A total of 12 Americans on six separate Apollo missions set foot on the Moon between July 1969 and December 1972. Since then, no humans have left Earth orbit, but more than 500 men and women have spent as many as 438 consecutive days in space. Starting in the early 1970s, a series of Soviet (Russian from December 1991) space stations, the U.S. Skylab station, and numerous space shuttle flights provided Earth-orbiting bases for varying periods of human occupancy and activity. From November 2, 2000, when its first crew took up residence, to its completion in 2011, the International Space Station (ISS) served as a base for humans living and working in space on a permanent basis. It will continue to be used in this way until at least 2024.</p>
<p>ince 1957 Earth-orbiting satellites and robotic spacecraft journeying away from Earth have gathered valuable data about the Sun, Earth, other bodies in the solar system, and the universe beyond. Robotic spacecraft have landed on the Moon, Venus, Mars, Titan, a comet, and four asteroids, have visited all the major planets, and have flown by Kuiper belt objects and by the nuclei of comets, including Halley’s Comet, traveling in the inner solar system. Scientists have used space-derived data to deepen human understanding of the origin and evolution of galaxies, stars, planets, and other cosmological phenomena.</p>
<p>Orbiting satellites also have provided, and continue to provide, important services to the everyday life of many people on Earth. Meteorologic satellites deliver information on short- and long-term weather patterns and their underlying causes. Other Earth-observation satellites remotely sense land and ocean areas, gathering data that improve management of Earth’s resources and that help in understanding global climate change. Telecommunications satellites allow essentially instantaneous transfer of voice, images, and data on a global basis. Satellites operated by the United States, Russia, China, Japan, India, and Europe give precision navigation, positioning, and timing information that has become essential to many terrestrial users. Earth-observation satellites have also become extremely useful to the military authorities of several countries as complements to their land, sea, and air forces and have provided important security-related information to national leaders.</p>
<p>As the many benefits of space activity have become evident, other countries have joined the Soviet Union and the United States in developing their own space programs. They include a number of western European countries operating both individually and, after 1975, cooperatively through the European Space Agency, as well as China, Japan, Canada, India, Israel, Iran, North Korea, South Korea, and Brazil. By the second decade of the 21st century, more than 50 countries had space agencies or other government bodies carrying out space activities.</p>

<p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star at the heart of our solar system, a hot, incandescent ball of hydrogen and helium. The Sun is around 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from Earth, and life as we know it would not be possible without its energy.</p>
<p>Our solar system's largest object is the Sun. To fill the Sun's volume, 1.3 million Earths would be required. Its gravity binds the solar system together, keeping everything in orbit around it in place, from the largest planets to the tiniest bits of debris. The Sun's core, where temperatures may reach 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius), is its hottest part. The Sun's activity has an impact on the nature of space throughout the solar system, from its violent eruptions to the continuous stream of charged particles it emits.</p>

<p><br> This star is roughly 22.8 light years away from the Sun, in our galaxy's Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm. It's a pulsar star, which means its light pulses due to its rotation. It rotates once every 0.9 seconds, which is extremely common for pulsar stars.</p>
<p><br>So, what's so intriguing about this celebrity? This star, on the other hand, prefers to vanish every now and then!
It was discovered in December 2008 and was initially mistook for a typical pulsar. Over the next year, experts researched this star, and just as they were about to wrap up their research, the star vanished!</p>
<p><br>We know that roughly 100 of the 2000 known pulsars stop pulsing for a few minutes to hours at a time. This is referred to as "nulling." Pulsars emit radio pulses all the time, and we view them by catching these radio pulses. They stop releasing radio pulses when they stop, therefore we won't be able to view them during this time.</p>
<p><br>Scientists watched this mysterious star for approximately a year and a half in the hopes that the pulsar would return, and it did in August 2011, 580 days later! Scientists were aware that they had discovered a rare pulsar subtype. What causes these stars to become invisible is still a mystery. Scientists can determine how rapidly the star is rotating by detecting the radio pulses it emits. Pulsars spin because of tremendous currents in their magnetospheres, and when these currents stop flowing, the pulsars slow down and finally stop spinning. However, the source of the present flow's interruption is unknown.</p>

<p><strong>Swift J1644+57: The Star That Got Eaten By A Blackhole</strong>
<br>
<img width="600" height="350" src="media\photos\stars\star_black_hole.webp"></p>
<p><br> <b>2. Swift J1644+57: The Star That Got Eaten By A Blackhole</b>
About 3.9 billion light years away in the constellation of Draco something strange happened. We all have heard about the "black holes" and the fact that it destroys anything that comes near it. Well, in this case it's a star, Swift J1644+57.
<br>
The event took place in another, smaller galaxy. Scientists first spotted it when they got a massive amount of X-rays and -rays from an otherwise quiet corner of the universe. The beam was discovered to be emanating from the center of another galaxy after more investigations. The beam was later determined to be the result of a "jet" emitted after a black hole devoured a star. The jet accelerated away from the incident at 99.5 percent the speed of light!</p>
<p><br>Most of the galaxies contains a central super-sized black hole. According to the studies it's been suggested that the black hole involved in this event is 1 millions times larger than the mass of Sun!</p>
<p><br>When a star falls into a black hole:
The star is ripped apart by the intense tides and leads to the formation of a gaseous disk that swirls around the black hole and gets heated up to millions of degrees. The innermost gas in the disk spirals towards the black hole, and because of the rapid motion and magnetism a dual, oppositely directed funnels are created through which some particles escape, known as jet. In case of Swift J1644+57 one of these jets pointed straight towards the Earth.</p>
<p><br>The timing considerations believed that the star that got devoured was a white dwarf. This was the first time that scientists witnessed this type of event from the beginning. This event is in actuallity really old, because it took 3.9 billion years for the light from there to reach Earth! </p>

<p><strong>The Star That's Older Than The Universe!</strong>
<br>
<img width="600" height="350" src="media\photos\stars\oldest_star.webp"></p>
<p><br> <b>3. HD 140283: The Star That's Older Than The Universe!</b>It's sounds unbelievable, but HD 140283, is older than Universe according to the calculations. It is estimated that this star is 14.46 ± 0.8 billions years old, whereas the universe is 13.79 ± 0.021 billions years.</p>
<p><br>Of course, the exact age of the star and the universe cannot be predicted. The age of this star is 14.46 ± 0.8 billions years. If you consider the lower limit i.e. if you minus 0.8 billion years it will come out to be 13.66 billion years, which means that is younger than the age of the universe i.e 13.79 ± 0.021 billions years. However, if you consider the upper limit, then it will be older than the universe. It's difficult to be certain  which one is it, but it is possible, according to the current calculation methods.Also known as the "Methuselah star", it is located about 190 light years away from us, in the constellation of Libra.</p>
<p><br>Facts:
<br>This is the oldest known star. There are other characteristics of this star that point to it being quite old. For starters, it's a sub-giant star, which means it's not a red giant but is on its way to becoming one (the 'nearing end' stage of a star). Second, it is a member of the population II star group. Metal composition is low in population II stars. In astronomy, "metals" refers to anything other than hydrogen and helium. The two elements generated by the big bang are hydrogen and helium. As a result, the initial generation of stars (population III stars) contained no metal. The first generation only lived for a few million years before succumbing to supernova explosions. The remnants of the first generation were then used to generate a second generation of stars, population II, which contained some (but still insignificant) metals. Population I stars come from the younger generations and have a lot of metal in them. Our Sun is an example of a star with a population of one.</p>
<p><br>This star was created in a distant dwarf galaxy and was gravitationally ripped and eaten by our Milky Way approximately 12 billion years ago. It encircles the Milky Way with an extended orbit. As a result, it travels past our solar neighborhood at a speed of 800,000 miles per hour, making it visible to the naked eye!</p>
<p><br>This is the oldest star that we know of. Who knows there are maybe much older stars somewhere out there!</p>

<p><strong>HV 2112: The Star Inside A Star!</strong>
<br>
<img width="600" height="350" src="media\photos\stars\star_inside_star.webp"></p>
<p><br> <b>4. HV 2112: The Star Inside A Star!</b>
Discovered in 2014, HV 2112 is a red supergiant located about 1,99,000 light years away in the nearby dwarf galaxy called the Small Magellanic Cloud, or Nebucula Minor, in the Tucana constellation.</p>
<p><br>Physicist Kip Thorne and astronomer Anna Zytkow predicted the existence of this star almost 40 years ago. They were founded in 1975 the existence of a hybrid object, known as Thorne-Zytkow object.</p>
<p><br>A Thorne-Zytkow object is a star that is generated when a red giant or supergiant star collides with a neutron star. What happens is that a star goes supernova, resulting in the production of a neutron star. However, a nearby red supergiant star collides with the neutron star and consumes it, resulting in the formation of a hybrid star. So in other words its a star inside a star! From outside its a red supergiant whereas the core is formed by a neutron star!</p>
<p><br>The chemical fingerprints of these objects differ from that of a typical red supergiant. It may appear to be a red supergiant from the exterior, but it is rich in rubidium, strontium, yttrium, zirconium, molybdenum, and lithium on the inside. The light emitted by HV2112 was investigated, and it was discovered that the light included a high concentration of certain components. These elements can be found in a regular red supergiant, but not in such large quantities.</p>
<p><br>This is the one and only star of its kind! It's the first time a Thorne-Zytkow item has been found. However, research is still underway to determine whether HV 2112 is a hybrid star.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="overview_1"><a name="Overview"></a><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p><b>Asteroids</b> are stony asteroids that circle the Sun. Asteroids orbit the Sun in the same way that planets do, but they are considerably smaller. In our solar system, there are many asteroids. The majority of them are found in the main asteroid belt, which lies between Mars and Jupiter's orbits.
Many asteroids are shattered fragments of planetesimals, things that never grew large enough to become planets within the early Sun's solar nebula.

Many asteroids are shattered fragments of planetesimals, things that never grew large enough to become planets within the early Sun's solar nebula.</p>
<p>Asteroids are distinguished from comets and meteoroids in a fairly arbitrary manner. The difference between asteroids and comets is one of composition: while asteroids are mostly made up of mineral and rock, comets are mostly made up of dust and ice. In addition, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing cometary ice from forming. The fundamental distinction between asteroids and meteoroids is size: meteoroids have a diameter of less than one meter, whereas asteroids have a diameter of more than one meter. Finally, meteoroids can be made up of asteroidal or cometary elements.
<br>
Only one asteroid, Vesta, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye, and this is only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time.[6] As of March 2020, the Minor Planet Center had data on 930,000 minor planets in the inner and outer Solar System, of which about 545,000 had enough information to be given numbered designations.

Only one asteroid, Vesta, with its very shiny surface, is generally visible to the human eye, and only when it is in a favorable location in very dark skies. Small asteroids travelling close to Earth may occasionally be visible to the naked eye for a brief period of time. [6] The Minor Planet Center possessed data on 930,000 minor planets in the inner and outer Solar Systems as of March 2020, with roughly 545,000 having enough information to be assigned numbers.</p>
<p>To raise awareness about asteroids, the United Nations designated June 30 as International Asteroid Day. The anniversary of the Tunguska asteroid impact over Siberia, Russian Federation, on June 30, 1908, is commemorated on International Asteroid Day.
<br>
"It is 100 percent guaranteed that humanity will be hit [by a deadly asteroid], but we are not 100 percent certain when," the B612 Foundation stated in April 2018. In his final book, Brief Answers to the Big Questions, published in 2018, scientist Stephen Hawking believed an asteroid collision to be the greatest hazard to the Earth. The US National Science and Technology Council warned in June 2018 that the country is unprepared for an asteroid impact, and has written and issued the "National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan" to help. According to expert evidence before the US Congress in 2013, NASA would need at least five years of planning before launching a mission to intercept an asteroid.

<p><br>
<img width="600" height="300" src="media/photos/planets/ceres.jpg">
<br>
<b>Ceres</b> is a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and therefore more information can be found in the section: Dwarf Planets. Ceres was the first asteroid discovered, on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi at Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Sicily. It was originally classed as a planet, but with the discovery of dozens of other objects in similar orbits in the 1850s, it was reclassified as an asteroid. It was classed as a dwarf planet in 2006 because, at 940 kilometers (580 miles) in diameter, it is the only asteroid large enough for its gravity to make it plastic and keep it as a spheroid.</p>

<p><br>
<img width="600" height="300" src="media\photos\asteroids\Pallas.jpg">
<br>
<b>Pallas</b> is the second asteroid discovered, following Ceres. It is thought to contain a mineral composition comparable to that of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites such as Ceres, however it is much less hydrated. It is the Solar System's third-largest asteroid in terms of both volume and mass, and it is most likely a leftover protoplanet. It is 79% the mass of Vesta and 22% the mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Its estimated volume is equivalent to a sphere 507 to 515 kilometers (315 to 320 mi) in diameter, 90–95% the volume of Vesta.</p>
<p>Objects grew in size through an accretion process to about the size of Pallas during the Solar System's planetary formation epoch. The majority of these protoplanets were absorbed into the formation of larger bodies that eventually became planets, while others were ejected by planets or destroyed in collisions with one another. Pallas, Vesta, and Ceres appear to be the only bodies from this early period of planetary formation that have survived within Neptune's orbit.</p>
<p>Pallas, like numerous asteroids in the early 19th century, was thought to be a planet when it was discovered by German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers on March 28, 1802. After the discovery of several asteroids after 1845, the terms "minor" and "major" planets were separated, and the recognition in the 1950s that such small things did not develop in the same way as (other) planets led to the gradual abandoning of the name "minor planet" in favor of "asteroid" (or, for larger bodies such as Pallas, "planetoid").</p>
<p>Pallas' orbit is notably sharply inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt, with an orbital inclination of 34.8°, rendering it comparatively inaccessible to spacecraft, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as great as Pluto's.

<h3 id="vesta"><a name="vesta"></a><strong>Vesta</strong></h3>
<p><br>
<img width="600" height="300" src="media\photos\asteroids\Vesta.jpg">
<br>
<b>Vesta</b> ,with a mean diameter of 525 kilometers, it is one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt (326 mi).  It was discovered on March 29, 1807[8] by German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers and named after Vesta, the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth.</p>
<p>Vesta is estimated to be the second-largest asteroid after the dwarf planet Ceres, both in terms of mass and volume, albeit its volume overlaps with the uncertainty in 2 Pallas' observations. It has a nominal volume that is only slightly higher than that of Pallas (approximately 5% greater, which is the scale of measurement uncertainties), yet it is 25 percent to 30% more massive. It constitutes an estimated 9% of the mass of the asteroid belt.Vesta is the only known remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) of the kind that formed the terrestrial planets. Collisions one and two billion years ago ejected numerous Vesta fragments, leaving two massive craters that cover much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a significant source of knowledge on Vesta, have fallen to Earth as a result of these events.</p>
<p>Vesta is the most visible asteroid from Earth. It can be as brilliant as magnitude 5.1 on a regular basis, making it faintly visible to the human eye. Though its orbit is wholly within that of Ceres, its maximum distance from the Sun is slightly more than Ceres' minimum distance.</p>
<p>Dawn, a NASA spacecraft, entered orbit around Vesta on 16 July 2011 for a one-year exploration and exited Vesta's orbit on 5 September 2012 on its way to Ceres. Dawn's data is still being analyzed by researchers in the hopes of learning more about Vesta's origin and history.

<p>Oceans cover over 70% of the planet's surface.
Approximately 97 percent of the world's water supply is found in the oceans.</p>
<p>Earth's oceans are unlike any other in our Solar System.
There is no liquid water on any other planet in our Solar System (although recent finds on Mars indicate that Mars may have had some liquid water in the recent past).
The oceans were the birthplace of life on Earth, and they continue to be home to an extremely complex web of life. </p>
<p>The oceans of the Earth perform a variety of tasks, including influencing weather and temperature.
They help to keep the Earth's temperature stable by absorbing solar radiation (stored as heat energy).
The thermal energy is distributed around the world by the ever-moving ocean currents.
During the winter, this warms the land and air, while during the summer, it cools it.</p>
<p>The oceans of the world are all linked together.
There were four acknowledged oceans until the year 2000: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic.
The International Hydrographic Organization designated a new ocean, the Southern Ocean, in the spring of 2000. (it surrounds Antarctica and extends to 60 degrees latitude).

<h3 id="description_1"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Atlantic Ocean, covering approximately 20% of Earth’s surface and separating the continents of Europe and Africa to the east from those of North and South America to the west. The ocean’s name, derived from Greek mythology, means the “Sea of Atlas.” It is second in size to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The area of the Atlantic without its dependent seas is approximately 31,568,000 square miles (81,760,000 square km), and with them its area is about 32,870,000 square miles (85,133,000 square km). It has an average depth (with its seas) of 11,962 feet (3,646 metres) and a maximum depth of 27,493 feet (8,380 metres) in the Puerto Rico Trench, north of the island of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica).</p>
<p>Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below −2 °C (28 °F) to over 30 °C (86 °F).</p>
<p>The Coriolis effect circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3–3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general, the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.</p>

<h3 id="description_2"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>According to Britannica, Arctic Ocean -smallest of the world’s oceans- centring approximately on the North Pole. The Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas—the Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, Kara, Barents, White, Greenland, and Beaufort and, according to some oceanographers, also the Bering and Norwegian—are the least-known basins and bodies of water in the world ocean as a result of their remoteness, hostile weather, and perennial or seasonal ice cover. This is changing, however, because the Arctic may exhibit a strong response to global change and may be capable of initiating dramatic climatic changes through alterations induced in the oceanic thermohaline circulation by its cold, southward-moving currents or through its effects on the global albedo resulting from changes in its total ice cover.</p>
<p>Although the Arctic Ocean is by far the smallest of Earth’s oceans, having only a little more than one-sixth the area of the next largest, the Indian Ocean, its area of 5,440,000 square miles (14,090,000 square km) is five times larger than that of the largest sea, the Mediterranean. The deepest sounding obtained in Arctic waters is 18,050 feet (5,502 metres), but the average depth is only 3,240 feet (987 metres) (Britannica, 2022).</p>
<p>The first surface crossing of the ocean was led by Wally Herbert in 1969, in a dog sled expedition from Alaska to Svalbard, with air support. The first nautical transit of the north pole was made in 1958 by the submarine USS Nautilus, and the first surface nautical transit occurred in 1977 by the icebreaker NS Arktika.</p>
<p>Since 1937, Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations have extensively monitored the Arctic Ocean. Scientific settlements were established on the drift ice and carried thousands of kilometres by ice floes.</p>
<p>In World War II, the European region of the Arctic Ocean was heavily contested: the Allied commitment to resupply the Soviet Union via its northern ports was opposed by German naval and air forces.</p>
<p>Since 1954 commercial airlines have flown over the Arctic Ocean</p>
<p>The crystalline basement rocks of mountains around the Arctic Ocean were recrystallized or formed during the Ellesmerian orogeny, the regional phase of the larger Caledonian orogeny in the Paleozoic Era. Regional subsidence in the Jurassic and Triassic periods led to significant sediment deposition, creating many of the reservoirs for current day oil and gas deposits. During the Cretaceous period, the Canadian Basin opened, and tectonic activity due to the assembly of Alaska caused hydrocarbons to migrate toward what is now Prudhoe Bay. At the same time, sediments shed off the rising Canadian Rockies built out the large Mackenzie Delta.</p>
<p>Due to the pronounced seasonality of 2–6 months of midnight sun and polar night in the Arctic Ocean, the primary production of photosynthesizing organisms such as ice algae and phytoplankton is limited to the spring and summer months (March/April to September).[67] Important consumers of primary producers in the central Arctic Ocean and the adjacent shelf seas include zooplankton, especially copepods (Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis, and Calanus hyperboreus) and euphausiids, as well as ice-associated fauna (e.g., amphipods). These primary consumers form an important link between the primary producers and higher trophic levels. The composition of higher trophic levels in the Arctic Ocean varies with region (Atlantic side vs. Pacific side) and with the sea-ice cover. Secondary consumers in the Barents Sea, an Atlantic-influenced Arctic shelf sea, are mainly sub-Arctic species including herring, young cod, and capelin. In ice-covered regions of the central Arctic Ocean, polar cod is a central predator of primary consumers. The apex predators in the Arctic Ocean—marine mammals such as seals, whales, and polar bears—prey upon fish.</p>
<p>Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem, and it is especially exposed to climate change, because it warms faster than the rest of the world. Lion's mane jellyfish are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the banded gunnel is the only species of gunnel that lives in the ocean.</p>

<h3 id="description_3"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Indian Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-fifth of the total ocean area of the world. It is the smallest, geologically youngest, and physically most complex of the world’s three major oceans (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian). It stretches for more than 6,200 miles (10,000 km) between the southern tips of Africa and Australia and, without its marginal seas, has an area of about 27,243,000 square miles (70,560,000 square km). The Indian Ocean’s average depth is 12,274 feet (3,741 metres), and its deepest point, in the Sunda Deep of the Java Trench (this explains a lot) off the southern coast of the island of Java (Indonesia), is 24,442 feet (7,450 metres).</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean is bounded by Iran, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh to the north; the Malay Peninsula, the Sunda Islands of Indonesia, and Australia to the east; the Southern Ocean to the south; and Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to the west. In the southwest it joins the Atlantic Ocean south of the southern tip of Africa, and to the east and southeast its waters mingle with those of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean has the fewest marginal seas of the major oceans. To the north are the inland Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The Arabian Sea is to the northwest, and the Andaman Sea to the northeast. The large gulfs of Aden and Oman are to the northwest, the Bay of Bengal is to the northeast, and the Great Australian Bight is off the southern coast of Australia.</p>
<p>40% of the sediment of the Indian Ocean is found in the Indus and Ganges fans. The oceanic basins adjacent to the continental slopes mostly contain terrigenous sediments. The ocean south of the polar front (roughly 50° south latitude) is high in biologic productivity and dominated by non-stratified sediment composed mostly of siliceous oozes. Near the three major mid-ocean ridges the ocean floor is relatively young and therefore bare of sediment, except for the Southwest Indian Ridge due to its ultra-slow spreading rate.</p>
<p>The ocean's currents are mainly controlled by the monsoon. Two large gyres, one in the northern hemisphere flowing clockwise and one south of the equator moving anticlockwise (including the Agulhas Current and Agulhas Return Current), constitute the dominant flow pattern. During the winter monsoon (November–February), however, circulation is reversed north of 30°S and winds are weakened during winter and the transitional periods between the monsoons.</p>
<p>As the youngest of the major oceans, the Indian Ocean has active spreading ridges that are part of the worldwide system of mid-ocean ridges. In the Indian Ocean these spreading ridges meet at the Rodrigues Triple Point with the Central Indian Ridge, including the Carlsberg Ridge, separating the African Plate from the Indian Plate; the Southwest Indian Ridge separating the African Plate from the Antarctic Plate; and the Southeast Indian Ridge separating the Australian Plate from the Antarctic Plate. The Central Indian Ridge is intercepted by the Owen Fracture Zone. Since the late 1990s, however, it has become clear that this traditional definition of the Indo-Australian Plate cannot be correct; it consists of three plates — the Indian Plate, the Capricorn Plate, and Australian Plate — separated by diffuse boundary zones. Since 20 Ma the African Plate is being divided by the East African Rift System into the Nubian and Somalia plates.</p>

<h3 id="description_4"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Pacific Ocean, body of salt water extending from the 60° S parallel in the south to the Arctic in the north and lying between the continents of Asia and Australia on the west and North America and South America on the east.Of the three major oceans, the Pacific is by far the largest, occupying about one-third of the surface of the globe. Its area, excluding the South China Sea, encompasses about 62.5 million square miles (161.76 million square km). It has double the area and more than double the water volume of the Atlantic Ocean—the next largest division of the hydrosphere—and its area more than exceeds that of the whole land surface of the globe. The Pacific Ocean stretches from the Bering Strait to 60° S latitude through more than 120° of latitude, nearly 9,000 miles (about 14,500 km). Its greatest latitudinal extent measures some 12,000 miles (about 19,000 km) along latitude 5° N, between the coasts of Colombia in South America and the Malay Peninsula in Asia. The mean depth of the Pacific (excluding adjacent seas) is 14,040 feet (4,280 metres), and its greatest known depth is 36,201 feet (11,034 metres)—in the Mariana Trench—also the greatest depth found in any ocean.</p>
<p>Though the peoples of Asia and Oceania have traveled the Pacific Ocean since prehistoric times, the eastern Pacific was first sighted by Europeans in the early 16th century when Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and discovered the great "Southern Sea" which he named Mar del Sur (in Spanish). The ocean's current name was coined by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan during the Spanish circumnavigation of the world in 1521, as he encountered favorable winds on reaching the ocean. He called it Mar Pacífico, which in both Portuguese and Spanish means 'peaceful sea'.</p>
<p>The volume of the Pacific Ocean, representing about 50.1 percent of the world's oceanic water, has been estimated at some 714 million cubic kilometers (171 million cubic miles). Surface water temperatures in the Pacific can vary from −1.4 °C (29.5 °F), the freezing point of seawater, in the poleward areas to about 30 °C (86 °F) near the equator. Salinity also varies latitudinally, reaching a maximum of 37 parts per thousand in the southeastern area. The water near the equator, which can have a salinity as low as 34 parts per thousand, is less salty than that found in the mid-latitudes because of abundant equatorial precipitation throughout the year. The lowest counts of less than 32 parts per thousand are found in the far north as less evaporation of seawater takes place in these frigid areas. The motion of Pacific waters is generally clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (the North Pacific gyre) and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Equatorial Current, driven westward along latitude 15°N by the trade winds, turns north near the Philippines to become the warm Japan or Kuroshio Current.</p>
<p>The climate patterns of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres generally mirror each other. The trade winds in the southern and eastern Pacific are remarkably steady while conditions in the North Pacific are far more varied with, for example, cold winter temperatures on the east coast of Russia contrasting with the milder weather off British Columbia during the winter months due to the preferred flow of ocean currents.</p>

<h3 id="description_5"><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>Southern Ocean, also called Antarctic Ocean, body of salt water covering approximately one-sixteenth of Earth’s total ocean area. The Southern Ocean is made up of the portions of the world ocean south of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica below 60° S. It is unbroken by any other continental landmass. Its narrowest constriction is the Drake Passage, 600 miles (about 1,000 km) wide, between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. In terms of area, only the Arctic Ocean is smaller.</p>
<p>The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean, using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel, was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019. The expedition's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60° 28' 46"S, 025° 32' 32"W, with a depth of 7,434 metres (24,390 ft). The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo, has proposed naming this deepest point in the Southern Ocean the "Factorian Deep", based on the name of the crewed submersible DSV Limiting Factor, in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 3, 2019.</p>
<p>The Antarctic Treaty was signed on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits military activity in the Antarctic to the support of scientific research.</p>
<p>The Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.</p>
<p>With a northern limit at 60°S, the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Extraterrestrial life, sometimes colloquially referred to as alien life, is hypothetical life that may occur outside Earth and which did not originate on Earth. Such life might range from simple prokaryotes (or comparable life forms) to intelligent beings and even sapient beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than humanity.</p>

<h3 id="drake-equation"><a names="drake_equation"></a><strong>Drake equation.</strong></h3>
<p>Astronomer Frank Drake took on the first attempt of extraterrestrial life(extraterrestrial intelligence) search, by creating an equation in order to evaluate the number of the extraterrestrial civilizations with communication abilities which exist at this moment in our galaxy.</p>
<p><img width="750" height="300" src="media/photos/extraterrestrial_life/Drake_equation.jpg"></p>

<p>When Frank Drake first created this equation, most of the terms were completely unknown. Nowadays, we have a clear picture only of the first three terms. The number of possible extraterrestrial civilizations is symbolized by the letter "N". The first term stands for the annual rate of star birth and is symbolized be the letter "R*" (approximately seven stars per year for our galaxy). The second term (fp) is the amount of stars which have planets. Nowdays, it is known that almost every star has planets, so we use number one, that is 100%. The term "ne" stands for the average number of planets per star, which are potentialy habitable (approximately 20% or 0,2). "fl" stands for the amount of planets in the habitable zone, where life exists indeed. Considering the only known example, life in Earth occured quite fast, since the circumstances became appropriate. Thus, some scientist put a number close to one (100% possibility of life occurrence) for this term. Some others are less optimistic and put smaller numbers. The next term, "fi" stands for the amount of planets with life form, which develops an intelligence equivalent to human's or higher. Most optimistic researchers state that since the moment life is born on a planet, higher intelligence will be developed rapidly, when others consider inteligence a rare phenomen. The term "fc" stands for the ammount of civilizations which develop communication technology and send messages to space. We don't know if other hypothetical civilization are interested to communicate. Perhaps communication to space is a singularity of human civilization. The last term "L" stands for the time period in which a civilization can be detected. That is the time in which civilizations emit detectable siagnals in space. "L" seems to be the most critical term, but is still unknown. Frank drake himself, by filling the numbers he knew and by guessing the rest gave a number between one thousend and one million civilizations in our galaxy. There comes however the million dollar question: If the ammount of extraterrestial civilizations is so big, why cant we find them?</p>

<h3 id="kardashev-scale"><a names="kardashev_scale"></a><strong>Kardashev scale</strong></h3>
<p>The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is able to use. The measure was proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964.The scale is hypothetical, and regards energy consumption on a cosmic scale. Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (types 0, IV through VI) and the use of metrics other than pure power.Carl Sagan’s modified Kardashev scale, which allows for continuous values, put humanity at a meagre 0.7. Some predict that our total power consumption could hit Type I levels on Sagan’s scale in around 200 years, but we are still incredibly far from realising Type II or III status.</p>

<p>According to the Kardashev Scale, civilizations can be divides into three basic categories, based on the amount of energy they are able to use.</p>
<p>Type I civilizations (Planetary civilizations), are those who have utilized their whole planet energy. A planetary civilization could possibly be able to control its planet's natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Type II civilizations (Stellar civilizations), are capable to use their whole star energy. Stellar civilizations could have made constructions like a Dyson sphere, a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its solar power output.</p>
<p>Type III civilizations (Galactic civilizations), are those who have harnessed the energy of its entire Galaxy and possibly colonized it.</p>

<h3 id="fermi-paradox"><a names="fermi_paradox"></a><strong>Fermi paradox.</strong></h3>
<p>The Fermi paradox is the conflict between the lack of clear, obvious evidence for extraterrestrial life and various high estimates for their existence. As a 2015 article put it, "If life is so easy, someone from somewhere must have come calling by now."</p>
<p>The great Italian-born physicist Enrico Fermi once asked some colleagues he was having lunch with the question: “Where are they?”, referring to the absence of any signs of extraterrestrial intelligences. This absence puzzled him, and his question later became known as Fermi’s paradox.</p>
<p>Maybe no civilization has managed to travel with speed greater than the speed of light. But even at speeds close to 10% of the speed of light a civilization could cross the entire Galaxy in the span of a million years. A number like that seems far too big, but it is actually just the 0.0077% of the age of the Galaxy. So there was plently of time for civilizations to colonize the entire Galaxy.</p>
<p>But why the universe is so silent?</p>
<p>Sources <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">wiki</a> , <a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/fermi.pdf">nickbostrom</a></p>
<h3 id="zoo-and-planetarium-hypothesis"><a names="zoo_planetarium_hypothesis"></a><strong>Zoo and Planetarium hypothesis.</strong></h3>
<p>The zoo hypothesis is one of many theoretical explanations for the Fermi paradox and speculates on the assumed behavior and existence of technologically advanced extraterrestrial life and the reasons they refrain from contacting Earth.</p>
<p>According to zoo hypothesis, extraterrestrials have fenced humanity in, and observing, studying or protecting it, allowing Earth to be developed freely and have natural sociocultural development, similarly to people observing animals at a zoo.</p>
<p>If there is a vast number of extraterrestrial civilizations, however, this theory may break down under the uniformity of motive concept because every civilization should agree to not act and interact with humanity. It would take just a single extraterrestrial civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within human range of detection for it to be undone, and the probability of such a violation of hegemony increases with the number of civilizations.</p>
<p>The planetarium hypothesis, conceived in 2001 by Stephen Baxter, also attempts to provide a solution to the Fermi paradox by holding that our astronomical observations represent an illusion, created by a Type III civilization (Kardashev scale) capable of manipulating matter and energy on galactic scales. He postulates that we do not see evidence of extraterrestrial life because the universe has been engineered so that it appears empty of other life.</p>
<p>Both zoo and planetarium hypothesis are considered by researchers highly speculative and more aligned with theological theories.</p>

<h2 id="zodiac_1"><a name="zodiac"></a> <strong>Zodiac</strong></h2>
<p>The zodiac is a belt-shaped section of the sky that stretches approximately 8 degrees north or south of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year (as measured in celestial latitude). The Moon's and visible planets' courses are all within the zodiac belt. </p>
<p>The zodiac is divided into twelve signs in Western astrology, and formerly astronomy: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Each sign occupies 30 degrees of celestial longitude and roughly corresponds to the star constellations: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn </p>
<p>These astrological signs make up a celestial coordinate system, or more specifically, an ecliptic coordinate system, in which the ecliptic serves as the origin of latitude and the vernal equinox serves as the origin of longitude. </p>

<br></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>With this illuminating work, prepare for a cosmic picture of our place in universal history, where celestial cycles pervade our Earthly lives. Marchant's book dives into our long-standing bond with the stars, which has influenced our personalities, religious beliefs, power systems, scientific progress, and even biology. We appear to have alienated ourselves from the universe that surrounds us during the last few centuries, and that is the theme she addresses here.</p>
<p>Marchant takes readers on a tour of humanity's relationship with the heavens throughout history, as well as the costs of our isolation from their influence. It's a re-examination of the potential of the universe we inhabit, its wonder, and its effect on our health, from the Hall of the Bulls in Lascaux to witnessing the winter solstice at an ancient tomb at Newgrange, to a visit with Medieval monks grappling with the nature of time and native Tahitian sailors navigating by the stars.</p>

Publisher: Norton &amp; Company 
<br></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Interstellar, the time-bending sci-fi epic directed by Christopher Nolan, was one of the most ambitious films of the decade, and now Kip Thorne delves into the physics behind the blockbuster Hollywood masterpiece. Thorne is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who worked on the scientific components of Interstellar with Nolan, which explains why it's one of the five most realistic space films ever made. This book describes how the film's mind-blowing events and breathtaking graphics are based on real-life science.</p>
<p>Thorne's observations are based on his screenwriting and filming experiences, and they describe the physical rules that control our universe and the things that surround it. You'll be enthralled as the author recounts his personal experiences as Nolan's science consultant while also delving into the underlying science.

In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – ALS, for short) that gradually, over the decades, paralysed him.After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.</p>

He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.Armstrong was born and raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio. A graduate of Purdue University, he studied aeronautical engineering his college tuition was paid for by the U.S. Navy under the Holloway Plan. He became a midshipman in 1949 and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the Korean War, flying the Grumman F9F Panther from the aircraft carrier USS Essex. In September 1951, while making a low bombing run, Armstrong's aircraft was damaged when it collided with an anti-aircraft cable, strung across a valley, which cut off a large portion of one wing. Armstrong was forced to bail out. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He was the project pilot on Century Series fighters and flew the North American X-15 seven times. He was also a participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs.</p>

Their naming occurs because the dust and gas are in the process of creating new stars, while the light of recently formed stars can also be observed. The name is also based on a phrase used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spurgeon">Charles Spurgeon</a> in his work "The Condescension of Christ"</p>
<p>The photo was taken on April 1, 1995 and it was declared as one of the top ten photographs from Hubble by <a href="https://www.space.com/">Space.com</a>. The astronomers that are responsible for the photgraph's capture were Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen. The same region of the Eagle Nebula was rephotographed by <strong>ESA's Herschel Space Observatory in 2011</strong> and by the <strong>Hubble Telescope in 2014</strong> with a newer camera. The photo depicted above is the 2014 version of the photograph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) is a deep-field image of a small region of space in the constellation Fornax, containing an estimated 10,000 galaxies. The original data for the image was collected by the Hubble Space Telescope from September 2003 to January 2004. It includes light from galaxies that existed about 13 billion years ago, some 400 to 800 million years after the Big Bang.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (HXDF)</strong>, released on September 25, 2012, is an image of a portion of space in the center of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image. Representing a total about 23 days of exposure time collected over 10 years, the image covers about 80% of the area of the HUDF. This represents approximately one thirty-two millionth of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>The HXDF</strong> contains about 5,500 galaxies, the oldest ones that are seen, <strong>are in the state they were 13.2 billion years ago</strong>. The galaxies that are dimmer, are one ten-billionth the brightness of what the human eye can see. The red galaxies in the image are the remainings of galaxies after big collisions during their oldest years. Many of the smaller galaxies in the image are very young, and eventually have developed to bigger galaxies.</p>

<p><strong>The Blue Marble</strong> is an image of Earth taken on December 7, 1972, about 29,000 kilometers from the planet's surface. It was taken by the <strong>crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft</strong> on its way to the Moon, and is one of the most reproduced images in history.</p>
<p>It mainly shows the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea to Antarctica. This was the first time the Apollo's path made it possible to photograph the south polar ice cap. In addition to the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar, almost the entire coastline of Africa is  visible in the photograph. The Asian mainland is on the horizon.</p>
<p>The photograph, taken on <strong>December 7, 1972</strong>, is one of the most famous and distributed photographs in existence. The astronauts had the Sun above them when they took the image. To the astronauts, the Earth had the appearance and size of a glass marble, that's why the photograph was called The Blue Marble.</p>

<p><strong>Pale Blue Dot</strong> is a photograph of planet Earth <strong>taken on February 14, 1990</strong>, by the <strong>Voyager 1</strong> space probe from a of about 6 billion kilometers. In the photograph, the Earth is depicted in almost one pixel. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The planet appears as a tiny dot against the endless space and bands of sunlight that are reflected by the camera."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voyager 1 had completed its primary goal and was leaving our Solar System. It was commanded by NASA to turn its camera and take one last photograph of Earth, the request came from the astronomer Carl Sagan. The phrase "Pale Blue Dot" was given by Sagan in his thoughts on the photograph's importance.</p>

<p><img alt="Black Hole image" src="media/photos/astrophotography/Black_Hole_2019.jpeg" title="The First Image Of A Black Hole" /></p>
<p><strong>In April 2019, a black hole and its shadow were captured in an image for the first time</strong>, a historic achievement by an global network of radio telescopes called the <strong>Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)</strong>.</p>
<p>A black hole is an extremely dense object from which no light can escape. Anything that comes within a black hole’s “event horizon,” its point of no return, will be consumed and will never be able to escape, because of the black hole’s immensely strong gravity. <strong>By its very nature, a black hole cannot be seen, but the hot disk of material that encircles it shines bright</strong>. Against a bright backdrop, such as this disk, a black hole appears to cast a shadow.</p>
<p>This breathtaking photograph shows the shadow of <strong>the supermassive black hole in the center of Messier 87 (M87)</strong>, an elliptical galaxy 55 million light-years away from Earth. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Football, better known as soccer in the US and Canada, is the most popular sport in the world, with an estimated following of 4 billion fans. Like some of the other sports on this list, the origins of football as we know it are in England in the 19th century, though history points to people playing similar games as far back as two thousand years, beginning in China. One reason for football’s popularity is that unlike other sports that require expensive equipment, all you need to play football is a ball and your foot. Hence, anyone, rich or poor, can enjoy the sport. It is played all over the world, but is particularly popular in Europe, Central and South America, and Africa.</p>

<p>Cricket boasts a fan base of 2.5 billion. The game is most popular in the UK and some former British colonies, notably India, Pakistan and Australia. Like baseball, it involves two teams, a bat, a large field, and scoring runs. There are significant differences, however, including a long rectangular pitch at the center of a cricket field, where the ball is thrown to a batsman, as opposed to a mound at the center of a baseball diamond facing a batter at home plate.</p>

<p>Invented by James Naismith, a Canadian teaching at a school in the US in the late 19th century, basketball is now played worldwide, and has an estimated following of 825 million. In basketball, two teams attempt to dribble a ball up a court and shoot it into a raised, hoop-shaped net to score points. If you like to run, jump, and shoot, then you’ll love the game of basketball. Like football (soccer), it is particularly popular because not much equipment is needed besides two baskets and a ball, and so is an accessible sport regardless of class.</p>

<p>Kilimanjaro, a volcanic massif in northeastern Tanzania near the Kenyan border, is Africa's highest peak. The massif stretches 50 miles (80 kilometers) east-west and is made up of three main extinct volcanoes, the youngest and highest of which includes a central cone, Kibo, that rises to 19,340 feet (5,895 meters). German geographer Hans Meyer and Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller were the first to reach the Kibo summit in 1889. Mount Kilimanjaro National Park was established in 1973 to conserve the mountain above the tree line as well as the six forest corridors that stretch downslope through the montane forest belt. In 1987, it was named a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Kangchenjunga, often spelled Kanchenjunga, is the world's third tallest peak. It rises to an elevation of 8,586 meters (28,169 feet) in the Kangchenjunga Himal region of the Himalayas, which is bordered on the west by the Tamur River, the north by the Lhonak Chu and Jongsang La, and the east by the Teesta River. [3] [1] It is located between India and Nepal, with three of the five summits, namely Main, Central, and South, located on the Indian side of the border[4], and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District.</p>
<p>Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was thought to be the world's highest mountain, but calculations based on numerous readings and measurements conducted by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 determined that Mount Everest was the highest mountain on the planet.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="1-space-is-completely-silent"><a name="fact1"></a><strong>1. SPACE IS COMPLETELY SILENT</strong></h3>
<p>There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard. </p>
<h3 id="2-the-hottest-planet-in-our-solar-system-is-450-c"><a name="fact2"></a><strong>2. THE HOTTEST PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IS 450° C.</strong></h3>
<p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury.  You would think that Mercury would then be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big fluctuations. </p>
<h3 id="3-a-full-nasa-space-suit-costs-12000000"><a name="fact3"></a><strong>3. A FULL NASA SPACE SUIT COSTS $12,000,000.</strong></h3>
<p>While the entire suit costs a cool $12m, 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module. However, the space suits that NASA uses were built in 1974.  If these were priced by today's pricing, they would cost an estimated 150 million dollars!</p>
<h3 id="4-the-suns-mass-takes-up-9986-of-the-solar-system"><a name="fact4"></a><strong>4. THE SUN’S MASS TAKES UP 99.86% OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</strong></h3>
<p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass attributed to helium.  If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?</p>
<h3 id="5-one-million-earths-can-fit-inside-the-sun"><a name="fact5"></a><strong>5.  ONE MILLION EARTHS CAN FIT INSIDE THE SUN</strong></h3>
<p>The Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the Earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of Earths? </p>
<h3 id="6-there-are-more-trees-on-earth-than-stars-in-the-milky-way"><a name="fact6"></a><strong>6. THERE ARE MORE TREES ON EARTH THAN STARS IN THE MILKY WAY</strong></h3>
<p>There are about three trillion trees on Planet Earth, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy.</p>
<h3 id="7-the-sunset-on-mars-appears-blue"><a name="fact7"></a><strong>7. THE SUNSET ON MARS APPEARS BLUE</strong></h3>
<p>Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, sunsets on Mars, according to NASA,  would appear bluish to human observers watching from the red planet. Fine dust makes the blue near the Sun's part of the sky much more visibilke, while normal daylight makes the Red Planet's familiar rusty dust color the most perceptible to the human eye.</p>
<h3 id="8-there-are-more-stars-in-the-universe-than-grains-of-sands-on-earth"><a name="fact8"></a><strong>8. THERE ARE MORE STARS IN THE UNIVERSE THAN GRAINS OF SANDS ON EARTH</strong></h3>
<p>The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way, which is why scientists can only estimate how many stars are in space.  However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.   While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.  That is an awfully big sand castle!</p>
<h3 id="9-one-day-on-venus-is-longer-than-one-year"><a name="fact9"></a><strong>9. ONE DAY ON VENUS IS LONGER THAN ONE YEAR.</strong></h3>
<p>Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 Earth days to complete its day. The orbit of Venus around the Sun is 225 Earth days, making a year on Venus 18 days less than a day on Venus.</p>
<h3 id="10-there-is-a-planet-made-of-diamonds"><a name="fact10"></a><strong>10. THERE IS A PLANET MADE OF DIAMONDS</strong></h3>
<p>There’s a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, is most likely covered in graphite and diamond.  Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for the $12 million dollar space suit needed to get there!</p>

<p>Christianity is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on Jesus of Nazareth's life and teachings. With around 2.5 billion adherents, it is the world's largest religion.  Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God, whose coming as the messiah was promised in the Hebrew Bible (called the Old Testament in Christianity) and recounted in the New Testament. They make up the majority of the population in 157 nations and territories.Christianity's Western and Eastern branches, as well as its doctrines on justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology, remain culturally distinct. The gospel, which means "good news," is referred to in the creeds of various Christian denominations as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind; and referred to in the creeds of various Christian denominations as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of The four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John describe Jesus' life and teachings, with the Old Testament serving as the gospel's foundation.</p>

<p>### <a name="Buddhis"></a><strong>Buddhism</strong></p>
<p>Buddhism is a Buddhist religion is an Indian religion or philosophical tradition based on Gautama Buddha's original teachings. It began as a Sramana custom in ancient India and expanded throughout Asia between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE. It is the fourth-largest religion in the world.Buddhists account for around 520 million people, or over 7% of the world's population.Buddhism comprises a wide range of traditions, beliefs, and spiritual practices, all of which are essentially founded on the Buddha's teachings (born Siddhrtha Gautama in the 5th or 4th century BCE) and the ideas that have resulted from them.The purpose of Buddhism, as stated in the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, is to eliminate suffering (dukha) produced by desire and ignorance of reality's true nature, which includes impermanence (anicca) and the non-existence of the self (anatt).Most Buddhist traditions emphasize transcending the individual ego through Nirvana or the path of Buddhahood, which ends the cycle of death and rebirth.Buddhist schools differ in their understanding of the path to enlightenment, the relative priority and canonicity accorded to various Buddhist texts, and their distinctive teachings and practices. Meditation, moral precept adherence, monasticism, taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and the growth of the Paramitas are all widely observed practices (perfections, or virtues). </p>

<p>### <a name="Atheism"></a><strong>Atheism/Agnosticism</strong></p>
<p>Atheism is defined as a lack of belief in the presence of gods in its broadest sense. Atheism, in a broader sense, is the denial of the existence of any gods. In a more limited sense, atheism refers to the belief that there are no gods. Atheism is opposed to theism, which is the belief in the existence of at least one deity in its broadest sense.The word atheism has its etymological basis from the ancient Greek o (atheos), which means "without god(s)" and was coined before the 5th century BCE. It was a derogatory epithet in antiquity for persons who were supposed to reject the gods revered by the broader society, those who were forsaken by the gods, and those who had no commitment to believe in the gods. The phrase referred to a social classification devised by orthodox religionists for persons who did not share their religious convictions. The term "atheism" was coined in the 16th century. With the rise of freethought, skepticism, and subsequent criticism of religion, the term's applicability became more limited. During the Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century, the first people to use the term "atheist" to describe themselves lived. Known for its "exceptional atheism," the French Revolution was the first great political movement in history to call for the supremacy of human reason. </p>

<p>### <a name="Taoism"></a><strong>Taoism</strong></p>
<p>The roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE. Early Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the School of Yinyang (Naturalists). It is based on the Chinese culture, the I Ching, which expounds a philosophical system about how to keep human behavior in accordance with the alternating cycles of nature. In Taoism, the Tao is the source of everything and the ultimate principle underlying reality. Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving perfection through self-cultivation. The Legalist Shen Buhai may also have been a major influence, expounding a realpolitik of wu wei, or qualified inaction.</p>

<p>### <a name="Islam"></a><strong>Islam</strong></p>
<p>Islam began in Arabia and was revealed to humanity by the Prophet Muhammad. Those who follow Islam are called Muslims. Muslims believe that there is only one God. The Arabic word for God is Allah. Retaining its emphasis on an uncompromising monotheism and a strict adherence to certain essential religious practices, the religion taught by Muhammad to a small group of followers spread rapidly through the Middle East to Africa, Europe, the Indian subcontinent, the Malay Peninsula, and China. By the early 21st century there were more than 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide. </p>

<p>### <a name="Hinduism_"></a><strong>Hinduism</strong></p>
<p>Hinduism is both a religion and a way of life in India. With roughly 1.2 billion followers, or 15–16 percent of the worldwide population, Hinduism is the world's third-largest religion. While Hinduism has been dubbed the world's oldest religion, many adherents refer to it as Santana Dharma (Sanskrit:, lit. "the Eternal Dharma"), which refers to the concept that its origins extend beyond human history, as revealed in Hindu writings. Vaidika dharma, the'dharma associated to the Vedas, is another, though less suitable, self-designation.</p>

<p>### <a name="Judaism_"></a><strong>Judaism</strong></p>
<p>Judaism is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, ethnic religion that encompasses the Jewish people's collective religious, cultural, and legal tradition and civilization. It began as an organized religion in the Bronze Age in the Middle East. According to some researchers, modern Judaism emerged from Yahwism, the ancient Israel and Judah religion, approximately 500 BCE, and is thus one of the oldest monotheistic religions. Religious Jews regard Judaism as the manifestation of God's covenant with the Israelites, their forefathers. It encompasses a large number of books, activities, theological perspectives, and organizational structures.</p>
