In the 1990s, data from the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that distant galaxies aren’t just moving away from our home galaxy, the Milky Way, they’re speeding away from us (and from each other) at an accelerating rate. That came as a big surprise — one that scientists have been struggling to explain ever since. What mysterious force is giving the galaxies this extra push? No one knows. But it’s been dubbed “dark energy,” and as with dark matter, Einstein is a key figure in the story.

In the early years of the 20th Century, scientists believed the universe was static — that, on average, galaxies remained the same distance from their neighbors. But the equations of general relativity seemed to indicate that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. That made no sense to Einstein, so he gave his theory a fudge factor that he called the “cosmological constant.”

A few years later, when astronomers discovered that the universe is expanding, it seemed the fudge factor was no longer needed. Yet now that we know that the universe’s expansion is accelerating, the cosmological constant may be making a comeback.

Whatever its true nature, dark energy plays an even greater role in cosmic evolution than dark matter. Our best estimate is that dark energy accounts for a more than two-thirds of the total energy of the visible universe. Taken together, dark matter and dark energy are an enormous mystery — and a bit of an embarrassment for the scientific community.

“I would give anything to know what dark matter and dark energy are,” Abraham says. “And I intend to devote the next couple of decades of my life to looking into it.”
