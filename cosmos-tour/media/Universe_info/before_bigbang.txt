Whenever a cosmologist gives a public lecture, someone in the audience inevitably raises a hand to ask, “Yes, but what came before the Big Bang?”

“There’s this textbook answer that we’re supposed to give,” says Glenn Starkman, a physicist at Case Western Reserve University. “We say that the question is meaningless, just as it’s meaningless to ask what’s south of the South Pole.”

The idea is this: If time itself began with the Big Bang, then it makes no sense ask what came before. There simply was no “before.” And yet Starkman knows that hardly anyone finds that answer satisfying.

We now have a model for what happened very shortly after the Big Bang. During the first tiny fraction of a second of the universe’s existence, the “inflation” model says that the universe expanded like a balloon, doubling in size again and again before slowing down to its “normal” rate of expansion. But if we try to look back before inflation — all the way back to “time zero” — general relativity breaks down.
